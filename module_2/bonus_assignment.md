### 1. Collect Your Data

- Download them in a format that can be imported into Excel or Google Sheets (e.g., `.CSV` or `.XLSX` files).

### 2. Categorize Transactions

### 3. Create a Pivot Table

  - Rows for the **categories**
  - Values are the corresponding spending amounts.
 
### 4. Filter Data 
 - Use filters to remove one-time expenses like trips, tuition etc to get an accurate picture of monthly expenses

### 5. Analyze Your Trends

  - Are there months where you consistently spend more?
  - Are there categories where your spending is higher than expected?
  - What surprises you, if anything?
  - What is your average monthly spending in each category? 

### 6. Reflect and Document
- Write a short reflection on your findings:
  - What changes (if any) would you like to make to your spending habits?
  - How has this exercise helped you understand your financial behavior better?

### 7. (Optional) Share Your Takeaways
